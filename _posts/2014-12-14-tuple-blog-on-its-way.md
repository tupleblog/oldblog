summary:    Tuple blog on its way.
---

By the inspiration of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (static site generator in Ruby) and [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com/) (including [Github](http://github.com)), two friends decided to start something together 
and come out as [Tupleblog](http://tupleblog.github.io/). 

We are currently learning about this awesome framework ([Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)) 
and its theme ([Pixyll](http://pixyll.com/)) hoping to make a good blog as soon as possible.

Have a good day!
